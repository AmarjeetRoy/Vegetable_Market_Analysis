# Vegetable Market Analysis

## Description

The Vegetable Market Analysis project is a group project aimed at conducting a comprehensive analysis of the vegetable market in different regions. The project involves data extraction and initial cleaning using Python, followed by further preprocessing and analysis using Excel. The extracted data from [https://vegetablemarketprice.com](https://vegetablemarketprice.com) is initially cleaned using Python, and then additional preprocessing and analysis tasks are performed using Excel.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of the project were:

1. Extracting real-time vegetable market data from [https://vegetablemarketprice.com](https://vegetablemarketprice.com) using Python.
2. Cleaning and preprocessing the extracted data using Python.
3. Performing additional preprocessing and analysis tasks using Excel.
4. Analyzing the price trends of various vegetables in different regions to identify patterns and variations.
5. Comparing vegetable prices between different markets to understand market dynamics and pricing differences.
6. Conducting a case study on the quick commerce vegetable business in Delhi to explore market potential and consumer preferences.

## Data Pre Processing
- We have Used Python's Numpy & Pandas Library for Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.

## Summary

This project is currently completed and serves as a demonstration of our skills in data extraction, cleaning, and analysis using Python and Excel. The Python code provided in the repository performs data extraction and initial cleaning tasks, while the Excel files contain additional preprocessing and analysis tasks.

## Future Scope

In the future, this project can be expanded by incorporating additional data sources, conducting further analysis on specific vegetable types, and exploring additional markets. The insights gained from this project can be used to develop strategies for farmers, retailers, and consumers in the vegetable market.
